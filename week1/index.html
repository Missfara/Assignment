  Kathryn Johanna Kuhlman was born near Concordia, Missouri to German-American parents Joseph Adolph Kuhlman and Emma Walkenhorst. Several years after a spiritual experience at age 14, she began itinerant preaching with her elder sister and brother-in-law in Idaho. Later, she was ordained by the Evangelical Church Alliance and later started her Ministry.
